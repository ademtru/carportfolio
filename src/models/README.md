# Documentation for 3D Models Used in the Car Portfolio

This directory contains the 3D models utilized in the car portfolio website. Each model is designed to enhance the interactive car experience and is optimized for performance in a web environment.

## Model Files

- **Climbing Wall Model**: A detailed model representing various climbing walls used in the car scene. This model includes different textures and geometries to simulate real-world climbing environments.
  
- **Car Holds**: A collection of 3D models representing various climbing holds. These models are designed to be placed on the climbing walls and come in different shapes and sizes to provide a realistic climbing experience.

## Usage

To use these models in the project, ensure they are imported correctly in the relevant scene files. The models should be loaded using appropriate loaders (e.g., GLTFLoader for GLTF/GLB files) and added to the Three.js scene.

## Optimization

All models are optimized for web use, ensuring that they load quickly and perform well in the browser. Textures are compressed, and polygon counts are kept to a minimum without sacrificing visual quality.

## Contribution

If you wish to contribute additional models or improvements, please follow the project's contribution guidelines and ensure that all new models adhere to the optimization standards set forth in this documentation.
